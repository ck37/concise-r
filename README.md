# A Concise Introduction to R

For Public Policy 290 "Analytics for Government Policy" by Avi Feller, Spring 2016.

The goal of this material is to provide a concise introduction to R & RStudio with sufficient training on fundamentals that students can understand R syntax, resolve common R errors, and complete basic data analysis. No prior knowledge of R is assumed, nor other programming experience. Each session is intended to take about 3 hours. After completion students should be familiar with R and able to teach themselves more advanced techniques using online resources.
